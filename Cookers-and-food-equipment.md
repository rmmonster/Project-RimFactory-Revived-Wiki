# Tier 1 Industrial Cooker
![](https://github.com/zymex22/Project-RimFactory-Revived/blob/master/Textures/SAL3/cooker1.png?raw=true)  
This cooker is a early type assembler with preset recipes in it.
it can take in raw food and produce food same as a vanilla stove.
This just does it automatically.

It works if you place raw food in white cells (input) that can be in a stockpile, vacuum hopper or I/O or IR rollers run by.
Yellow cell are output and will output food, a I/O, belt can put it away from output and avoid clogging machine.

Industrial cooker can cook ANY recipe from Vanilla stove (even modded) that require level 10 or less cooking.

# Tier 3 Spacer Cooker

This work same as above, only difference is its faster, and will never poison food and can cook any recipe up to level 20 cooking.

# Industrial Food Processor
![](https://github.com/zymex22/Project-RimFactory-Revived/blob/master/Textures/SAL3/smart_prepper.png?raw=true)  
This was originally mad as mod support for VGP gourmet, rimcousine and now vanilla cooking expanded.
but it can also make wort if none of above mods are installed.

# Meat Grinder
![](https://github.com/zymex22/Project-RimFactory-Revived/blob/master/Textures/SAL3/smart_butcher.png?raw=true)  
Meat grinder can butcher all creatures into useful meat and secondary resources.
it copies all recipes from vanilla butcher table.

# Fermenting Tank
![](https://github.com/zymex22/Project-RimFactory-Revived/blob/master/Textures/SAL3/brewer.png?raw=true)  
This tank work automatically and can input/output to make a production line.
it uses power so optimal temperature isn't a issue here either.

This will get more mods support later, its just need some work.


# Mod support
optimized for mods like vgp, vgp gourmet, rimcousine core, vanilla cooking expanded.
it will also support any mod adding recipes to vanilla benches is these machines as much as possible will try to copy vanilla benches for maximum mod support right away.

feel free to suggest more support.
