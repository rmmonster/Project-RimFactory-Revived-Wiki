This cooker is a early type assembler with preset recipes in it.
it can take in raw food and produce food same as a vanilla stove.
This just does it automatically.

It works if you place raw food in white cells (input) that can be in a stockpile, vacuum hopper or I/O or IR rollers run by.
Yellow cell are output and will output food, a I/O, belt can put it away from output and avoid clogging machine.

Industrial cooker can cook ANY recipe from Vanilla stove (even modded) that require level 10 or less cooking.
