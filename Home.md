This version is focused around B18 version wich was awesome version of PRF.
I included storage againg and left insanity and drones out to match that.

Also i have Tried expanding on what mod was and original todo list, combined with some of my own ideas.
Goal is to get that feel of Automation and Fabrication there was in B18 (inspired by Factorio)

I have tried adding some new items in a prf/factorio flavour to expand what can be automated and how it can, and also bring some more progression in this mod.
I aimed for 3 tiers(+insanity) wich spans from early industrial to late spacer tech.
And balanced it with input in comments and discord to meet most players expectation to this mod,
as i dont feel its mine i just wanna maintain it and bring it back to life/game

I updated what i felt need an update to match 1.1 standards
and also got a texture overhaul (textures are done by a kind "unknown alien" on my discord)
And im very gratefull for that, as it leave more room for me to do other part of this and my other mods.
He do it of free will and when inspired so thats why not every texture are done.

This was my Favorite mod in B18 and B19 and there never really came a 1.0.
Since Spdskatr have giving up on updating it, i thought i would give it a go to update it.
I got Spdskatrs blessing to continue PRF, so hope i can honor it.

I hope i can bring back Project RimFactory to a good state in 1.1
Sadly im not a C# programmer, i can compile assemblies but it stops there.
So if you are, and wanna help feel free to contact me or make PR on Github with fixes/updates.
Im getting help from LWM and Nobo sometimes.
