Mining random ores after placed and powered, it will have a chance of getting infestation. chance can be turned off with mod settings or chance lowered with Incedent tweaker (deep drill infestation chance)

This version will mine steel slag instead of raw steel.

This is same as above version just faster between mines, less chance to get stone chunks, and mine Raw steel instead of slag.

This miner is entirely then both above.
It works by you setting up a bill to mine a primary ore eq. steel.
it will then mine steel and have a chance of mine rare or junk items also.

All rare vanilla ores have been turned off default but can be put on by turn off miners nerf in mod settings.
Then it can mine any ore in game.

This miner have no chance of infestation
